# Our other projects
I would like to add about other projects that came out from under our team - Discord bots. One of them came out so well that he was able to surprise the jury and get a well-deserved first place. The bot was an assistant for teachers on the Discord platform to conduct lessons comfortably and also help them with difficulties that might arise during the learning process.
